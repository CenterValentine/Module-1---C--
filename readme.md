# Overview

This CLI application allows text files to be parsed or tokenized in order to gather text based insights about the text document.  In the world of LLMs, word and language patterns are key and this application takes a basic but important step toward these actions.

{Provide a description of the software that you wrote to demonstrate the C++ language.}

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

The primary driver of developing this application was a study and focus on archtecture.  The goal was to plan out as much of the project as I could before starting in order to avoid blocks.  I even reviewed SLDC in order to examine and reflect on the impact my planning choices might have.

I used AI tools to provide articles, tutorials and research explaining basic C++ archetecure principles.  Much caution was taken when using AI to ensure the full learning experience and much time has been simple learning and relearning the language using simple resources, namely W3, to review beginnner to intermediate C++ concepts.

I looked at basic C++ project templates and tried to commit this structure to memory by adding it to my deep learning notes.
